When sprouts appear, gently transplant the root to a 3-gallon (11 liter) pot, covering the top of the root with only 5cm (2 in) of soil. Add additional soil as the stems grow taller, and water as needed to keep the soil lightly moist. Ginger is most often grown in double rows, spaced 30cm (12 in) apart, with open working space between the double rows.",

Purchased plants of better cultivars start fruiting three years after planting, and will bear fruits of a predictable size and colour, in a defined harvest period. Set out purchased plants in late winter or early spring, setting the plant so the root ball is 2 cm (1 inch) above the soil line. Planting avocados too deep encourages root rot diseases. Because avocados grow well in semi-desert climates, they often need supplemental water. Use a drip system that covers the root area of the tree, and water deeply overnight every seven to 10 days.  Avocados are usually grown as single specimens. When multiple trees are planted, allow 6 m (20 feet) between plants. Dwarf avocado varieties mature to 3 m (10 feet) tall; standard varieties can grow to 9 m (30 feet) tall. Not recommended for growing in containers as avocados are stressed by crowded roots and prone to developing root rot diseases when grown in containers.",

Trees can be pruned to control their size and make the fruits easier to pick. Ripening times vary widely with cultivar and can range from autumn to early summer. Mature avocado trees are prone to bearing heavily some years and others not at all. Avocados need little pruning beyond snipping out root suckers or awkward branches in spring, just as the plants finish flowering. Tall-growing varieties can be pruned to grow into broad, low-growing trees to make the fruits easier to reach.",
            "harvesting": "Judging the ripeness of avocados takes practice, complicated by the way the fruits finish ripening after they are harvested. When you think fruits are ripe based on size and slightly dull appearance, clip a few with short stems attached, and place them in a paper bag at room temperature. Ripe avocados will start to soften in a week, while immature ones will shrivel. Avocados ripen over a long period, so check trees weekly for fruits that are ready to harvest.",

Cultivated mangoes are kept small, to 6 m (20 feet) tall and wide to make the fruit easy to harvest. Container growing is not recommended. Mangoes can be grown in pots for a year or two but will not reach their productive potential until after they are planted in the ground.",
            "frostTolerant": "No. Mangoes are tropical evergreen trees with little tolerance for cold. They are hardy only to about -1°C (30°F).",

            "notes": "Native to India, mango is the national tree of Bangladesh. Mangoes are tropical trees that grow best in climates with cool, dry winters and hot, steamy summers. Improved cultivars that grow best in various parts of the world are available. Mangoes benefit from pruning once a year after the fruit is harvested. Prune to control the plant’s size and to remove crowded branches.",
            "harvesting": "Mangoes are ready to harvest when they start to change colour and feel very slightly soft when squeezed. Wearing gloves and a long-sleeved shirt, cut mature green mango clusters and let them finish ripening in a shady place. Mango sap can be highly irritating and also can cause blemishes on otherwise perfect fruits.",

Red mulberry is native to eastern North America and makes a valuable wildlife tree, supporting more than 30 species of berry-eating birds. Unlike most fruit trees, which are pollinated by insects, mulberries are pollinated by wind, which has resulted in extensive crossing of species. Avoid planting mulberries near entryways or parking areas, because dropped fruits can cause messy stains. Mulberries can be pruned when they are dormant, though they tend to bleed when cut. Top back trees when they reach the height you want, and they will respond by growing stronger lateral branches.",

Exposure to cool winter nights is required for olives to set flower buds, and then the fruits need a long, dry summer to mature. For these reasons olives are difficult to grow for edible fruit or oil in all but a few climates outside of their native range. Where olives grow well, they are lovely specimen trees with gray-green foliage and white flowers in early spring. Most olives are self-fertile, but because olives are wind pollinated, growing more than one tree can improve fruit set. Trees start bearing three to five years after planting. In some communities in the southwestern US olives are unwelcome because of their spring pollen, which causes an allergic reaction in some people. Lightly prune olive trees while they are in bloom to shape the plants into a strong structure, remove awkward branches, and increase light penetration into the centre of the canopy.",

Quince fruits are ripe when they turn from green to yellow and the fruits snap easily from the branch when pulled. In many climates the fruit is still green when harvested before the first freeze, in which case the fruits should be clipped with short piece of branch attached. Handle quince fruits gently because they bruise very easily. Spread them in a single layer in a cool room to ripen for two to four weeks before cooking them into jams and jellies, which modifies their natural astringency.

Set out plants as early as possible, while the soil is still cool. Take care not to bury the crown, which can lead to rotting. Young plants need water when they are actively growing. A surface mulch suppresses weeds while making the plants look more attractive. Hellebores resent root disturbance and need dividing only every five years or so. To propagate a plant, dig the clump and rinse off the root before cutting it into four or more sections with a sharp knife. Replant immediately.

The plants should start blooming their first year. Yarrow also can be started from purchased plants. The best cultivars of tall, yellow fernleaf yarrow are propagated vegetatively, so you will need to start with purchased plants in spring or early summer. Yarrows need less water than other perennial flowers and do not do well with very wet conditions. Yarrows more than two years old grow into clumps that are connected with shallow roots.

Common yarrow (A. millefolium) produces a strong flush of pastel to red flowers in early summer, followed by modest reblooming later in the season. Yarrows that bloom yellow to orange are usually A. filipendulina hybrids, which produce their long-lasting flowers all at once in midsummer. Common yarrow is native to temperate climates in many parts of the world, where it colonises roadways and other disturbed sites. Historically, yarrow foliage was used to treat bleeding wounds.",

Established plants are easy to propagate using the method known as layering. Bend a long branch until its tip is in contact with soil. Cover the stem with a bit of soil and a brick or other weight. After the stem develops roots, it can be dug up and planted elsewhere. Forsythias also can be propagated by rooting stem cuttings taken in spring, after the plants finish blooming. Forsythias need regular water for the first year or two after planting. Once they are established, water forsythias only during droughts. Check plant tags for the plant’s mature height and width, and adjust spacing accordingly. It is generally not recommended to grow forsythia in containers because even dwarf cultivars spread their branches and grow into very wide little shrubs. Young plants can be held in containers for a year if they are attentively watered, or they can be grown as outdoor bonsai.",

The plants shed their leaves in autumn, and bloom on bare wood in late winter or early spring. Because they bloom so early, blossoms may be damaged by late freezes. In cold climates, look for forsythia cultivars with good bud hardiness such as ‘Fiesta’ and ‘Meadowlark’.  Proper pruning is essential to getting a heavy set of flowers. Forsythias bloom on year-old wood that starts growing as soon as flowering subsides. Pruning in late spring gives the plants plenty of time to set flowering buds for the following year. Prune large forsythias by cutting out the oldest branches near the ground. Avoid the temptation to shear forsythias into tight shapes. They look best when allowed to keep their long, arching branches.",

Highly acidic soils turn flowers blue, while pink predominates in alkaline soils. Many modern varieties are less sensitive to soil pH changes.",
            "position": "Full sun to part shade. Large, white-flowered panicle hydrangeas can be grown as specimen shrubs in a sunny lawn, or pruned to grow as sculpted small trees. colourful bigleaf hydrangeas are often damaged by winter cold, so they are best grown in sheltered spots with part-day shade. Oakleaf hydrangea grows best in partial shade.",
            "sowPlant": "Set out purchased plants in spring at about the time of your last frost. Container-grown plants can be set out through early summer. Water regularly, and cover the root zone with an organic mulch to keep the soil moist at all times. Spacing varies with the type grown, but hydrangeas should usually be grown at least 1.5m (5 feet) apart. Hydrangeas often are grown as single specimen plants, or several may be used to structure woodland landscapes. Check plant tags for a plant’s mature width when planting hydrangeas as hedges or in combination with other shrubs.",
            "frostTolerant": "Cold tolerance varies with species, with some hardy to -26°C (-15°F). Popular bigleaf hydrangeas are often injured by winter temperatures below -12°C (10°F).",

            "notes": "Visit local display gardens to learn about the best hydrangeas for your area. If you admire hydrangeas growing in neighbours’ yards, check with local garden centres for matching plants. Take your time making choices, because hydrangeas are large, long-lived shrubs that will be with you for many years. The need to prune varies with species, but most hydrangeas can be pruned to shape them and control their size in early winter or in spring. Delay hard pruning of bigleaf hydrangea until mid-spring, when you can see which buds survived winter. ",

Also see Azaleas, closely related plants that bloom earlier than rhododendrons. Technically, azalea is a type of rhododendron that blooms in spring, has funnel-shaped flowers, with stamens limited to five. Rhododendrons are larger plants that bloom in early summer, with dense flower clusters at the ends of branches, and thick, leathery leaves. A few cultivars like ‘PJM’ show characteristics of both groups.  Rhododendrons seldom need pruning, but any trimming should be done in summer, after the plants bloom.

Most dark-leaved smoke bushes turn brilliant red in the autumn. Smoke bush needs little pruning beyond the removal of damaged branches in summer.

Older varieties of Japanese spirea became invasive in some parts of the US and Europe, but the introduction of seed-sterile cultivars such as ‘Neon Flash’ has solved this problem. The need to prune varies with cultivar. Prune bridal wreath spirea in early summer by cutting out old branches close to the base of the plant. Japanese spirea can be pruned in autumn or early spring to remove dead branches and keep the plants neat. Japanese spirea blooms on new wood.",
            "harvesting": "All spireas make good material for cut flower arrangements. The airy flower heads of Japanese spirea can hung in small bunches to dry.",

            "troubleshooting": "As members of the rose family, spirea may occasionally show leaf spots and leaf damage due to moth larvae, but they are seldom subject to serious damage. Spireas are of little interest to deer.",

Bend a long branch until its tip is in contact with soil. Cover the stem with a bit of soil and a brick or other weight. After the stem develops roots, it can be dug up and planted elsewhere. Winter jasmine also can be propagated by rooting stem cuttings taken in spring, after the plants finish blooming. Winter jasmine needs regular water for the first year or two after planting. Once the plants are established, they need water only during droughts. Allow 6 feet (2 m) between plants when planting winter jasmine as a hedge. For containers, place one plant per 14-inch (35 cm) wide pot. Install a small trellis to help hold some of the long stems that will grow the first year. Winter jasmine is a popular plant for outdoor bonsai.",

Several improved varieties are available with leaves that start out green and darken to purple in response to warmth and sun. ‘Red October’ become redder as the season progresses. Shorter than big bluestem but equally useful in meadows, little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) grows to 1m (3 feet) high, and makes a wonderful grass for windswept hillsides.

Leave 2 m (6 feet) between plants when multiple clematis are planted on a fence or wall. Most clematis are grown as single specimens trained up a post or trellis.

They are the perfect vines for training on a pillar. Bloom times vary, and most cultivars tend to bloom all at once. Most gardeners choose large-flowered hybrid clematis because of their mesmerising show of huge blossoms, but there also are species native to almost every temperate climate. In the UK, native Clematis vitalba, old man’s beard or traveller’s joy, is a common site in autumn hedgerows. In the US, native Clematis virginiana, virgin’s bower, is quite similar. There are many other native species worthy of consideration. Most cultivated clematis require moderate pruning, which varies with the plant’s bloom time. If an overgrown plant needs pruning, you can never go wrong by doing it after flowering ends. New growth will then be directed toward new buds for the following season. Trim off dead or damaged branches in spring, taking care to avoid cutting back bud-bearing branches. The best way to propagate clematis is to root stem cuttings taken in summer, after the flowers fade. Some cultivars root readily, but it’s still a good idea to root twice as many cuttings as you hope to grow.",

Avoid planting Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), which is extremely invasive in a wide range of climates. Bush honeysuckles also are on the no-plant list in many areas because of their tendency to spread into wild areas. Prune honeysuckles to shape the plants and control their size.

Japanese wisteria is similar, with better cold hardiness. Unlike the Asian wisterias, which bloom only in spring, the American species often rebloom in summer when grown in hospitable sites. Wisteria are exuberant woody vines that need sturdy support and annual pruning. Prune in midsummer, after the flowers have gone, removing as much growth as needed to control plant size. Plants grown on pergolas may need additional pruning in late summer to keep them from taking over outdoor living space.",

Choose a coconut in which you can hear the water swishing inside when you shake it, and soak it in a pail of water for two days. Plant the coconut on its side, with only half of the nut covered with soil. When kept warm and moist, a coconut will germinate in three to four months. Coconuts that sprout naturally can be lifted and transplanted when the leaf shoot emerges. Maintain steady soil moisture after planting coconuts. The trees need plenty of moisture and sun to support strong growth. Most coconuts grow to 30 meters (100 feet) tall, though a few dwarf cultivars are available.  Coconuts have shallow roots and need constant moisture, which makes them poor candidates for containers. However, coconuts can be germinated in containers and then transplanted a few months later when the leaf sprouts appear.",

Many temperate climates host native species, though the European stinging nettle is easiest to manage in the garden. In addition to the buttery greens that are harvested in spring, stinging nettle is a host plant for several important butterfly species in the UK, Europe and the US. The stems and leaves of stinging nettle are armed with hairs that can cause burns or blisters on human skin. Grow them far from children’s play areas or walkways, as the plants tend to bend into an arch late in summer. In a remote bed, nettles mix well with goldenrod and tall garden phlox.",
            "harvesting": "In early spring, as soon as plants show new growth, use scissors to snip off 10 cm (4 inch) stem tips. Wear gloves to protect your hands from stings. Thoroughly wash harvested nettles in a colander, spin or shake dry, and store in the refrigerator. Cleaned nettles can be dried for use as a nutritional supplement for humans or animals. Lightly steam fresh spring nettles before using them in soup, pesto, or other cooked dishes. Any form of cooking destroys the stinging hairs.
